## Why R3?
Guy Kawasaki says: "The hardest part about getting started is getting started" and it is so true for procrastinators like us. All of us wanted to read articles/posts/books about the things they are interested in but some thing or the other comes in the way or sometimes, we are just too lazy. Here, we say goodbye to all of that!

The main motivation behind creating this group is move our lazy asses to do something productive in our spare time. We believe that a schedule and deadline will force us to participate more actively in reading and discussion. Each person in the group will give a talk in a round robin fashion on a topic of their interest. We plan to have a session every Monday.

## Group members:
Udbhav, Kashyap, Pavan, Prabhav, Adithya.

## Schedule (with links to material)
### Upcoming: Apr 3, 2017: [San Fransisco Housing Crisis] (by Kashyap)
### Mar 27, 2017: [Basic Economics](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-844AnmP8ZRNGxwLVZ0cHplRDA) (by Udbhav)
Reference: [Principles of Economics by Mankiw](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-7th-Mankiws/dp/128516587X) <br>
The talk is primarily structured around first two chapters of the book. Chapter1 provides a brief introduction to economics and then talks about the principles of economics - principles for individuals, principles for interactions and principles for the whole economy. Chapter 2 provides some of the economic models such as circular flow diagram and production possibilities frontier.
