## Why r<sup>3</sup>?
Guy Kawasaki says, "the hardest part about getting started is getting started", and it's *so* true for procrastinators like us. All of us want to read articles, posts, and books about the things we're interested in; but something or the other gets in the way, and sometimes, we are just too lazy. Here, we say goodbye to all of that!

The main motivation behind creating this group is to motivate our lazy asses to do something productive in our spare time. We believe that a schedule and deadline will force us to participate more actively in reading and discussion. Each person in the group will give a talk in a round-robin fashion on a topic of their interest. We plan to have a session every Monday.

## Group Members
Udbhav, Kashyap, Pavan, Prabhav, Skanda

## Schedule

Reference: [How Burrowing Owls Lead To Vomiting Anarchists (Or SF's Housing Crisis Explained)](https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/)<br/>
I'll review what the crisis looks like in numbers, some of the global housing trends such as "The Great Inversion", and the development of the "Slow Growth" movement in SF and California, beginning with the 1950s. We'll look at how rent control came to be, how neighborhood groups and developers have worked with policies and regulations, and where tech fits into all of this.
